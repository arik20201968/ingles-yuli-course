# Lesson 2.2: Articles and Nouns

## Introduction
Nouns are words for people, places, and things. In English, we use articles (**a, an, the**) before nouns.

## Indefinite Articles: A / An
We use **a** or **an** when we talk about something for the first time or something "not specific".
*   Use **A** before a consonant sound: *A book, A car, A house.*
*   Use **An** before a vowel sound: *An apple, An egg, An ice cream.*

## Definite Article: The
We use **The** when the listener knows exactly which thing we are talking about.
*   *The sun, The moon.*
*   *I have a book. **The** book is red.*

## More Examples
*   **A** teacher / **A** student.
*   **An** orange / **An** umbrella.
*   **The** door / **The** windows.
