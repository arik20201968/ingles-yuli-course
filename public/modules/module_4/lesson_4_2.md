# Lesson 4.2: Present Simple (Part 2) - Negative and Questions

## Introduction
To make negative sentences and questions in the Present Simple, we need the auxiliary verb **DO / DOES**.

## Negative Sentences (Subject + Do/Does + Not + Verb)
*   **I / You / We / They** + **do not** (**don't**): *I don't play tennis.*
*   **He / She / It** + **does not** (**doesn't**): *She doesn't like pizza.*

**IMPORTANT**: When you use *doesn't*, the verb **loses** its "-s":
*   *He speaks English* -> *He **doesn't speak** English.*

## Questions (Do/Does + Subject + Verb?)
*   **Do** you speak English? -> *Yes, I do. / No, I don't.*
*   **Does** he live here? -> *Yes, he does. / No, he doesn't.*

## Short Answers (Respuestas cortas)
*   **Do you like coffee?**
    *   Yes, I **do**.
    *   No, I **don't**.
*   **Does she live here?**
    *   Yes, she **does**.
    *   No, she **doesn't**.
