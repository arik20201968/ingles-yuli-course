# Lesson 4.1: Present Simple (Part 1) - Affirmative

## Introduction
The **Present Simple** is used to talk about habits, routines, and general truths.

## Affirmative Structure
*   **I / You / We / They** + Verb: *I eat apples.*
*   **He / She / It** + Verb(**s**): *She eat**s** apples.*

## The "Third Person" Rule
When using **He, She, or It**, we usually add an **-s** to the verb:
*   *I work* -> *He work**s***
*   *I speak* -> *She speak**s***
*   *I play* -> *It play**s***

## Special Endings
*   If the verb ends in **-ch, -sh, -x, -s, or -o**, add **-es**:
    *   *Watch* -> *Watch**es***
    *   *Go* -> *Go**es***
*   If the verb ends in **consonant + y**, change to **-ies**:
    *   *Study* -> *Stud**ies***

## Daily Routine Examples
*   I **wake up** at 7:00 AM.
*   She **has** breakfast with her family.
*   We **work** from Monday to Friday.
*   He **goes** to the gym in the afternoon.
