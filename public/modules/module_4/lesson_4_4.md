# Lesson 4.4: Adverbs of Frequency

## Introduction
How often do you do things? We use adverbs of frequency to explain this.

## Frequency Scale
*   **Always** (Siempre) - 100%
*   **Usually** (Usualmente) - 80%
*   **Often** (A menudo) - 60%
*   **Sometimes** (A veces) - 40%
*   **Never** (Nunca) - 0%

## Word Order
These adverbs usually go **before** the main verb, but **after** the verb "To Be".
*   *I **always** drink coffee.* (Before verb "drink").
*   *I am **always** happy.* (After verb "To Be").
